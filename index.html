        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>HI! Hi, I’m Jade Powell, a 28-year-old web designer with a background shaped by technology, creativity, and real-world experience.
I grew up during the rise of the internet, smartphones, and digital everything. Technology has always been part of my life — but web design wasn’t something I initially saw as my future. That changed once I actually started doing it. What began as something new quickly became something I genuinely enjoy.
Over the past decade since graduating high school, life has taken me down many different paths. Along the way, I’ve learned adaptability, problem-solving, and how to work with people from all walks of life. Those experiences now shape how I approach design: thoughtfully, practically, and with the user in mind.
I especially enjoy working with small local businesses and community-driven projects, helping them create an online presence that feels authentic, accessible, and effective — not cookie-cutter or corporate.
I don’t pretend to know exactly where life will take me next, but I do know this: I’m excited to be here, I’m enjoying the work, and I’m ready for whatever comes next.</p>
